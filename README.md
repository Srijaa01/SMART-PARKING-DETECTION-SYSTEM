# SMART-PARKING-DETECTION-SYSTEM
TITLE : Smart parking detection system PURPOSE : Using technology to effectively manage parking spaces is the goal of a smart parking detection system. Here is a concise summary of its goals:

1. Cut Down on Time Spent Looking for Parking
By directing cars straight to open spaces, smart parking systems reduce the amount of time and gas that is wasted on roundabouts.

2. Enhance the Flow of Traffic
Smart systems contribute to congestion relief by minimizing needless vehicle movement in parking lots or around city blocks.

3. Improve User Experience
Parking is made more convenient and less stressful for drivers by providing them with real-time updates through apps or digital signage. TECHNOLOGIES USED : Python,opencv,YOLO,ultralytics. USAGE : By using real-time data from sensors and smartphone apps, it helps drivers find parking spots quickly, cutting down on the amount of time they spend looking for a spot. This contributes to a cleaner environment by reducing vehicle emissions and easing traffic congestion in addition to improving user convenience. These systems also enable city planners and parking operators to keep an eye on usage trends, better manage available space, and make well-informed decisions about future infrastructure planning. All things considered, smart parking technology promotes sustainable development, increases safety, and facilitates urban mobility. CONCLUSION : The output of a Smart Parking Detection System typically includes a combination of real-time data, visual indicators, and user-accessibleÂ information.
